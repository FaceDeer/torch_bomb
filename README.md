## Torch Bomb

If you've ever been exploring a cave and found a deep, dark hole in the ground with no clue as to what was below, this is the mod for you. Ignite a torch bomb and three seconds later it'll blast torches into the walls (and ceiling and floor) in every direction.

One torch bomb will fire up to 42 torches (though usually much less than that) in a radial pattern around itself, with a minimum range of 5 meters (the torches are going too fast closer than that and shatter without a trace) and a maximum range of 40 meters from the detonation point. Torch bombs are falling nodes when lit, much like TNT.

Three torch bombs can be combined into one mega torch bomb. A mega torch bomb can fire up to 162 torches with a range of 120 meters from the detonation point (three times that of a regular torch bomb). The minimum range of this monster is 15 meters, and it produces enough of a blast to destroy nodes within 3 meters, so take care. One of these is suitable for illuminating a very large cavern with walls and ceiling too distant to reach otherwise.

TNT is an optional dependency, but torch bombs don't have a crafting recipe (and don't produce a damaging blast) without the tnt mod enabled.

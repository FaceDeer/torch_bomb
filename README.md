## Torch Bomb

If you've ever been exploring a cave and found a deep, dark hole in the ground with no clue as to what was below, this is the mod for you.

Throw a torch grenade and it will explode on impact, firing up to 12 torches 30 meters away from the detonation point to embed themselves in whatever surfaces they hit.

For surveying a larger chamber three torch grenades can be combined into a single torch bomb. Place the bomb block and ignite it by punching it with a torch. Three seconds later it'll detonate and fire up to 42 torches 40 meters away from the detonation point. Torch bombs are falling nodes when lit, much like TNT, but you need to punch them a second time once they are lit to make them fall.

Three torch bombs can be combined into one mega torch bomb. A mega torch bomb can fire up to 162 torches with a range of 120 meters from the detonation point. It produces enough of a blast to destroy nodes within 3 meters, so take care. One of these is suitable for illuminating a very large cavern with walls and ceiling too distant to reach otherwise.

TNT is an optional dependency for this mod, but torch bombs don't have a crafting recipe (and don't produce a damaging blast) without the tnt mod enabled.
